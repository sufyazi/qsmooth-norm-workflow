## Containerizing an R Script for HPC Deployment

This repository contains the code and instructions for containerizing an R script for deployment on a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. The R script used in this repository contains a function that uses `qsmooth` normalization R package to be applied to a specific input file. The goal is to demonstrate how to create a Docker container for an R script and run it on an HPC cluster using Singularity.
